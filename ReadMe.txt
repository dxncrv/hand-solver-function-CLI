This zip contains a C# console app running on .NET 7.0 framework.
May require .NET SDK to run the app on terminal if using VS Code.

Script location:
app/PokerSolver.cs

Executable location:
app/bin/Debug/net7.0/app.exe

Thank you!

This was made in a short amount of time so the logic is not ideal but it worked for the scope of the project.
